For my midterm project, I wanted to create an interactive art piece that included video; after discovering the OpenCV-Processing library and looking through some [examples](https://github.com/atduskgreg/opencv-processing#morphologyoperations), I was really interested by the processes within the library that morphed the video in some shape or form. I decided to pursue this idea and to add a wide variety of video morphing effects controlled by the user to create an art piece out of their own video feed.

As for how I programmed this project, I used both the Open-CV and the Video Libraries within Processing to accomplish what I wanted to do. I used many of the effects that belonged to OpenCV such as [Opening, Closing,](https://docs.opencv.org/trunk/d9/d61/tutorial_py_morphological_ops.html) and Blurring; I then connected these effects with the live video feed through the "video" object within the Video Library. I also utilized many of the events within Processing such as mousePressed() and keyPressed() in order to tie the effects with user interactivity. I created counters that fed into each effect and whenever the user would trigger an event, the respective counters would be increased. I utilized the mouseWheel() event to reset all of the counters so that the user could start with a clean slate again. As an added bonus, I also added functionality for mouse position by attaching the opencv.flip() method to both the y and x positions of the cursor. Lastly, I had to separate the video.start() method from the setup() function because I needed to show the instructions screen first.

I ran into multiple difficulties within this project, including not knowing how to combine two libraries that I had just been introduced to, figuring out how different values effected each of the effects, and also how to attach an instruction screen before the video feed started. I learned a lot about computer vision through this project and got to use a lot of the functionalities my programming friends used in the past. I feel like I have a much better understanding of what computer vision is now and also how we are able to harness it to create some really exciting art pieces!
