I was able to program two different functionalities for my interactive piano; the first one is that I am able to control the brightness of the LEDs according to the volume/amplitude
of the piano sounds. The second one is that I am able to control the LED color based on which key is being played (disregarding octave); so if I play C it will shine orange,
D it will shine green etc.

Unfortunately, I accidentally fried the ACDC adapter I was using to power the LEDs so I am only able to power 5 LEDs with the arduino right now; I have ordered a replacement and it 
should be coming on Tuesday. Going forward, I plan on combining these two functionalities and sending them both over serial at the same time, adding in transition between colors,
and also adding in functions for chord detection. Also, I plan on hooking up the new adapter and powering all 200 LEDs throughout the piano to make it a really nice light show.
