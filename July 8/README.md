The environment I chose to draw was being with my girlfriend. I chose to draw this environment because even though I have visited many amazing places myself, visiting those same places with her makes the experience much more meaningful. The distance caused by Covid has also made me more appreciative of the time we spent together in person and the memories we have made together. It's a pretty simple portrait with a minimalistic depiction of me and my girlfriend coupled with a heart in the middle to illustrate what our relationship is.

The main difficulty of this project was figuring out how to draw the heart. I looked up some ways to draw the heart directly within Processing, but the code was a bit too complicate for me to parse; I then found out that you can import .svg files from Illustrate using the PShape function. However, when I tried to draw the heart in Illustrator the first time, the .svg file was not exported correctly so it didn't work on processing. I had to redraw the heart a few times before it finally worked. Other than that, it was a bit difficult making sure everything was positioned right using my eye since there were no grids within the drawing.
