What if you could see what the piano sounded like?

Chromesthesia or sound-to-color synesthesia is a type of synesthesia in which sound involuntarily evokes an experience of color, shape, and movement.
And while many piano players have hints of this condition, including me, we rarely can fully flesh out the grand multitude of colors that a piano piece creates when we are playing it.

I wanted to undertake this project to create a fully functional, piano visualizer that utilizes LEDs to create an artficial "chromesthesia"; by hooking up microphone input to
processing and my arduino to a strip of LEDs, I was able to design and engineer an interactive auditory and visual experience that can be enjoyed by professional piano players to
beginners who have never touched an instrument before.
