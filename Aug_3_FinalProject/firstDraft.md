For my final project I want to create an interactive piano; what I mean by this is a piano that can sense what notes and tones you are playing and then output a corresponding signal,
whether through different LED colors, the speed of a servo motor, or something else. I believe this project uses both the arduino (for processing audio waves from the piano) and
also processing (for outputting different colors based on the audio waves). I would secure lights around the piano so that whenever I play warmer tones, there would be warmer colors
and whenever I play cooler tones, there would be cooler colors. There could even be more complex algorithims coded in to have special colors only appear when you play a specific
set of tones in a specific order.
